  "explanation": "The AIT201 component, responsible for measuring conductivity, showed a slight decrease of 0.01% from its baseline, indicating a minor fluctuation that may not significantly impact operations. In contrast, AIT402 and AIT502, which measure ORP, exhibited substantial increases of 80.49% and 87.40%, respectively, suggesting a sudden and significant change in the chemical environment being monitored.",
  "potential_impact": "The minor change in AIT201 is unlikely to affect system performance, but the drastic increases in AIT402 and AIT502 could indicate potential chemical imbalances or contamination, which may lead to operational inefficiencies or equipment damage if not addressed promptly. These anomalies in ORP readings could disrupt processes that rely on stable chemical conditions, potentially affecting product quality and safety."
