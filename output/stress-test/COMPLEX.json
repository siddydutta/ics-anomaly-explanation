  "explanation": "The AIT201 component, which measures conductivity, showed a slight decrease in its detected value from the baseline, indicating a potential drop in the conductivity level being measured. This sudden change of -0.01% suggests that the system may be experiencing a transient issue or a minor disturbance affecting the conductivity measurement.",
  "potential_impact": "As AIT201 is connected to multiple PID controllers (P201 to P208), any fluctuation in its readings can lead to incorrect control actions, potentially affecting the overall process stability and efficiency. If the conductivity is critical for process control, this anomaly could result in suboptimal operation or even process failure."
