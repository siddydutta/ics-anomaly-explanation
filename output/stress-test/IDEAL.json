  "explanation": "The components AIT402 and AIT502, which measure ORP, showed significant increases in their detected values (\u219180.49% and \u219187.40% respectively) compared to their baselines. This sudden change indicates a possible malfunction or a drastic shift in the chemical environment they monitor, likely affecting the accuracy of the readings.",
  "potential_impact": "Given that AIT402 and AIT502 are critical for monitoring ORP levels, such anomalies could lead to incorrect process control decisions. This could compromise the integrity of the system, potentially resulting in unsafe operating conditions or product quality issues."
