  "inference": "The P102 component, a Raw Water Transfer Pump, is critical for maintaining water flow in the system. Anomalies in this component could indicate reconnaissance activities (Discovery) to identify vulnerabilities.

  "explanation": {
    "explanation": "The detected anomaly in the Raw Water Transfer Pump (P102) shows a significant increase in operational parameters, rising from a baseline of 1.28 to 2.00, indicating a potential modification of operational settings. This sudden change suggests that the pump may be operating outside its intended design specifications, which could lead to mechanical failure or safety hazards.",
    "possible_cause": "This anomaly aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK technique T0836 (Modify Parameter), where an adversary may have altered the operational parameters of the pump, resulting in unexpected performance. Additionally, it could also relate to T0837 (Loss of Protection), where protective systems may have been compromised, allowing the pump to operate under unsafe conditions.",
    "potential_impact": "The increase in pump parameters could lead to equipment damage, prolonged process disruptions, and potential safety hazards for personnel. Given the pump's critical role in transferring raw water, such anomalies could also result in significant operational downtime and financial losses.",
    "mitigation_strategy": "To address this anomaly, it is crucial to implement strict audit and authorization enforcement measures to prevent unauthorized parameter modifications. Additionally, enhancing human user authentication and validating program inputs can help safeguard against similar attacks in the future."
