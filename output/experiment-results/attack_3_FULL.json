  "inference": "The AIT202 component is a pH and ORP sensor, critical for monitoring and controlling chemical processes. Anomalies in such sensors can indicate unauthorized access or manipulation (Discovery), which can lead to impaired process control (Impair Process Control) and ultimately impact the overall system performance (Impact). These tactics are relevant due to the potential for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in sensor data to disrupt operations.",

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      \n\nAn adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators.

Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations.

Reporting messages are important for monitoring the normal operation of a system or identifying important events such as deviations from expected values. \n\nIf an adversary has the ability to Spoof Reporting Messages, they can impact the control system in many ways.

  "explanation": {
    "explanation": "The AIT202 component, responsible for measuring pH and ORP levels, has shown a significant drop in its readings from a baseline of 8.37 to 6.00, indicating a potential malfunction or external interference affecting its measurements.",
    "possible_cause": "This anomaly could be attributed to the attack technique T0836 (Modify Parameter), where an adversary may have altered the parameters controlling the pH and ORP readings, leading to unexpected values. Additionally, T0837 (Loss of Protection) could have compromised protective functions, allowing for unmonitored changes in the system.",
    "potential_impact": "The drop in pH and ORP readings could lead to improper chemical processes, risking equipment damage and safety hazards. This could also result in significant production losses and regulatory compliance issues due to the failure to maintain proper chemical balances.",
    "mitigation_strategy": "To mitigate this anomaly, it is crucial to implement strict authorization enforcement and validate program inputs to prevent unauthorized parameter modifications. Regular audits and monitoring of application logs can help detect any suspicious changes in the system."
