Methods of manipulating control can include changes to set point values, tags, or other parameters. Adversaries may manipulate control systems devices or possibly leverage their own, to communicate with and command physical control processes.

(Citation: John Bill May 2017) (Citation: Shelley Smith February 2008) (Citation: Bruce Schneier January 2008) Using this remote, the student was able to capture and replay legitimate tram signals. As a consequence, four trams were derailed and twelve people injured due to resulting emergency stops.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.      \n\nAn adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0105) to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\nDetection: Application Log Content, Asset Inventory, Network Traffic Content, Device Alarm\nMitigation: Audit, Authorization Enforcement, Human User Authentication, Validate Program Inputs\n---\nSource Type: attack_technique\nID: T0837\nName: Loss of Protection\nDescription: Adversaries may compromise protective system functions designed to prevent the effects of faults and abnormal conditions. This can result in equipment damage, prolonged process disruptions and hazards to personnel. \n\nMany faults and abnormal conditions in process control happen too quickly for a human operator to react to. Speed is critical in correcting these conditions to limit serious impacts such as Loss of Control and Property Damage. \n\nAdversaries may target and disable protective system functions as a prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future faults and abnormal conditions to go unchecked. Detection of a Loss of Protection by operators can result in the shutdown of a process due to strict policies regarding protection systems. This can cause a Loss of Productivity and Revenue and may meet the technical goals of adversaries seeking to cause process disruptions.\n*************\n\nProvide a concise, data-driven analysis.

  "explanation": {
    "explanation": "The AIT504 component, responsible for measuring conductivity, has shown a drastic increase in detected values from a baseline of 14.64 \u03bcS/cm to 255.00 \u03bcS/cm, indicating a significant anomaly likely due to manipulation of control parameters or a fault in the measurement system.",
    "possible_cause": "This anomaly could be attributed to attack techniques such as T0831 (Manipulation of Control) or T0836 (Modify Parameter), where an adversary may have altered setpoints or parameters to produce an unexpected conductivity reading.",
    "potential_impact": "Given that AIT504 measures RO permeate conductivity, such a spike could lead to improper process control, potentially damaging equipment or affecting product quality, which may result in financial losses and safety hazards.",
    "mitigation_strategy": "To mitigate this anomaly, implement strict authorization enforcement and validate program inputs as per T0836, alongside ensuring communication authenticity to prevent manipulation of control signals as outlined in T0831."
