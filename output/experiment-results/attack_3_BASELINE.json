  "explanation": {
    "explanation": "The AIT202 component, responsible for measuring pH and ORP, has shown a significant drop in its readings from a baseline of 8.37 to 6.00, indicating a potential malfunction or external interference affecting its measurement capabilities.",
    "possible_cause": "This sudden change may be indicative of a sensor tampering or manipulation attack, potentially aligning with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1071.001 (Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols) where adversaries may exploit communication protocols to alter sensor data.",
    "potential_impact": "Given that AIT202 is critical for monitoring chemical processes, a drop in pH and ORP readings can lead to improper chemical reactions, potentially causing safety hazards or product quality issues in the industrial process.",
    "mitigation_strategy": "To mitigate this anomaly, implement integrity checks and anomaly detection systems on sensor data, as suggested by MITRE ATT&CK technique T1040 (Network Sniffing), to monitor for unusual patterns and ensure data authenticity."
