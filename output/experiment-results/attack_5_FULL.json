  "inference": "The DPIT301 is a critical component in monitoring differential pressure in the ultrafiltration unit. Anomalies in this component could indicate attempts to discover vulnerabilities in the system (Discovery), disrupt the normal operation of the filtration process (Impair Process Control), or cause damage to the system or its outputs (Impact). These tactics are relevant due to the potential for attackers to exploit such components to manipulate or disrupt industrial processes.",

Brute Force I/O may be achieved by changing either a range of I/O point values or a single point value repeatedly to manipulate a process function. The adversary's goal and the information they have about the target environment will influence which of the options they choose. In the case of brute forcing a range of point values, the adversary may be able to achieve an impact without targeting a specific point. In the case where a single point is targeted, the adversary may be able to generate instability on the process function associated with that particular point. \n\nAdversaries may use Brute Force I/O to cause failures within various industrial processes.

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters.

By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0105) to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.\nDetection: Application Log Content, Asset Inventory, Network Traffic Content, Device Alarm\nMitigation: Audit, Authorization Enforcement, Human User Authentication, Validate Program Inputs\n---\nSource Type: attack_technique\nID: T0837\nName: Loss of Protection\nDescription: Adversaries may compromise protective system functions designed to prevent the effects of faults and abnormal conditions.

  "explanation": {
    "explanation": "The differential pressure indicating transmitter (DPIT301) experienced a significant spike in readings from a baseline of 19.55 to 45.00, indicating a sudden and abnormal increase in pressure differential. This anomaly suggests a potential malfunction or external manipulation affecting the pressure readings, which could disrupt the ultrafiltration process.",
    "possible_cause": "This statistical signature aligns with the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T0806 (Brute Force I/O) and T0836 (Modify Parameter), where adversaries may have altered the pressure readings or manipulated I/O values to create instability in the process. Such actions could lead to erroneous data being reported by the DPIT301, indicating a failure in the system's integrity.",
    "potential_impact": "The abnormal pressure readings can lead to improper functioning of the ultrafiltration unit, potentially causing equipment damage, process inefficiencies, or safety hazards. Given the critical role of DPIT301 in monitoring pressure, this anomaly could result in significant operational disruptions and financial losses.",
    "mitigation_strategy": "To address this anomaly, implement network segmentation and filter network traffic to prevent unauthorized access to control systems, as suggested by the MITRE ATT&CK framework. Additionally, enforce authorization and audit processes to ensure that only legitimate changes are made to system parameters, thereby safeguarding against manipulation."
