An anomaly in this component could indicate an attempt to inhibit its response function, potentially leading to unauthorized control over water supply. Additionally, impairing process control could disrupt the treatment process, while discovery tactics may be employed by an attacker to gather information about the system and its components.",

By blocking these reporting messages, an adversary can potentially hide their actions from an operator.\n\nBlocking reporting messages in control systems that manage physical processes may contribute to system impact, causing inhibition of a response function.

By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause [Impact](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0105) to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations.

  "explanation": {
    "explanation": "The MV101 component, an electric actuated valve for raw water, showed a significant increase in its operational state from a baseline of 0.93 to 2.00, indicating a sudden and abnormal activation. This spike suggests that the valve may have been manipulated to open or close unexpectedly, potentially due to unauthorized parameter modification or alarm suppression.",
    "possible_cause": "This anomaly could be attributed to the MITRE ATT&CK techniques T0836 (Modify Parameter) or T0878 (Alarm Suppression), where an adversary modifies the control parameters or suppresses alarms to manipulate the valve's operation without detection.",
    "potential_impact": "Given MV101's role in controlling the raw water supply, this anomaly could lead to improper water flow management, risking overflows or insufficient supply to the treatment process, which may compromise water quality and operational safety.",
    "mitigation_strategy": "To address this anomaly, implementing network allowlists and static network configurations can help prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, enforcing strict audit and authorization processes will ensure that only legitimate modifications to control parameters are permitted."
