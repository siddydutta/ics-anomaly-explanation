  "inference": "The DPIT301 is a critical component in monitoring differential pressure in the ultrafiltration unit. Anomalies in this component could indicate attempts to discover vulnerabilities in the system (Discovery), disrupt the normal operation of the ultrafiltration process (Impair Process Control), or cause damage to the system or its outputs (Impact). These tactics are relevant due to the potential for attackers to exploit weaknesses in monitoring and control systems.",

These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters.

Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations.

  "explanation": {
    "explanation": "The DPIT301, a Differential Pressure Indicating Transmitter, shows a significant spike in detected values (45.00) compared to the baseline (16.24), indicating a sudden and abnormal increase in differential pressure. This suggests a potential malfunction or an external manipulation affecting the pressure readings, which could compromise the filtration process.",
    "possible_cause": "This anomaly could be attributed to the MITRE ATT&CK technique T0836 (Modify Parameter), where an adversary may have altered the parameters controlling the pressure readings, resulting in an unexpected high value. Additionally, T0837 (Loss of Protection) could apply if protective measures were disabled, allowing for uncontrolled pressure changes.",
    "potential_impact": "The abnormal pressure reading could lead to equipment damage or failure in the ultrafiltration stage (P3), potentially causing a loss of control over the filtration process and risking contamination of the treated water. This could also result in significant operational downtime and financial losses due to the need for repairs and process interruptions.",
    "mitigation_strategy": "To address this anomaly, implement strict authorization enforcement and validate program inputs to prevent unauthorized parameter modifications (T0836). Additionally, ensure that protective system functions are regularly audited and maintained to prevent a loss of protection (T0837), thereby safeguarding against abnormal conditions."
